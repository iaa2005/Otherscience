One of the floors of the candle house consists of a central corridor and eight identical apartments (it remains a mystery how people enter the corner apartments). In winter, residents decided to save money and heat only half of the apartments. At first, they turned on the heating only in the corner apartments, the temperature in the corridor was 10 Â°C. After that, they decided to heat only the central apartments. The temperature in the corridor has increased 3 times. Find the temperature:

1. on the street, if it remained constant throughout the experiment;

2. in all apartments with each heating method.
   
Notes: the heating power is constant and does not depend on external factors. The power of heat loss is proportional to the area of the wall and the temperature difference. Heat losses between floors should be neglected.
